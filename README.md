# Bonk Bat

This mod allows players to craft a unique wooden bat using any vanilla wood type. Once crafted, this bat comes with a special twist â€“ every time you hit an enemy, it plays a humorous sound effect inspired by the popular meme. Whether you're exploring caves, battling mobs, or just having fun with friends, the 'Bonk Bat' adds a touch of comedy to your Minecraft adventures. Unleash the power of bonk and enjoy a lighthearted twist to your gameplay!

But beware - sometimes, even mobs will equip themselves with a bonk bat, and will not hesitate to bonk back!
